<p>This instructor training material is focused on helping competent practitioners
and experts teach their knowledge to others. It also serves a
kickstart to teaching available ENCCS lessons.</p>
<p>The material presented here is partly derived from two instructor training resources
developed in the <a class="reference external" href="https://coderefinery.org/">CodeRefinery project</a> as well as the instructor
training lesson from <a class="reference external" href="https://carpentries.org/">The Carpentries</a>:</p>

<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/">Carpentries Instructor Training</a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Inspiration has also been drawn from the free online book
<a class="reference external" href="https://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html">Teaching Tech Together</a> by Greg Wilson.</p>
<p>After attending a workshop covering this material, learners should:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Have increased confidence in teaching interactive workshops in online and in-person settings.</p></li>
<li><p>Be familiar with important pedagogical concepts and scientific findings about how people learn
new skills.</p></li>
<li><p>Appreciate the importance of frequent hands-on practice in building skill.</p></li>
<li><p>Understand how learning can be improved by following certain best practices in interactive teaching.</p></li>
<li><p>Know how to backwards-design training material based on intended learning outcomes.</p></li>
<li><p>Know about important differences between online and in-person training and how inherent challenges
in online training can be overcome.</p></li>
<li><p>Be familiar with a technical approach to collaboratively developing open source lessons based
on a template.</p></li>

<h3>Prepare a short teaching demo (20 min)<a class="headerlink" href="#prepare-a-short-teaching-demo-20-min" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Think about a topic that you know well, that you’ve taught before, or that you want to teach in the future.
Think about a hands-on approach to how to teach it and prepare a 3-5 minute demo.
It’s good if the demo is based on a sequence of steps that you prepare and explain during the demo.</p>
<p>During the instructor training workshop you will be asked to teach this topic to a small group of other participants and receive feedback.
Your 3-5 minute demo does not need to be complete; it’s fine if you only include the initial steps of a larger thing.</p>
<p>Since this workshop is focused on teaching technical topics, it might be useful if your topic is also technical and involves showing shell commands,
programming constructs or similar. But it can also involve navigating a graphical user interface (GUI) or using some computational tool.</p>

<h4>Carpentries audience<a class="headerlink" href="#carpentries-audience" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>The Carpentries aims to teach computational <strong>competence</strong> to learners through an applied approach, avoiding the theoretical and general in favor of the practical and specific.
<strong>Learners do not need to have any prior experience in programming.</strong>  One major goal of a Carpentry workshop is to raise awareness on the tools researchers can learn/use to speed up their research.</p>
<p>By showing learners how to solve specific problems with specific tools and providing hands-on practice, learners develops confidence for future learning.</p>
<div class="admonition-novices callout admonition" id="callout-0">
<p class="admonition-title">Novices</p>
<p>Carpentry learners can be qualified as <strong>novices</strong>: they do not know what they need to learn yet. A typical example is the usage of version control: the Carpentry <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span></code> lesson aims to give a very high level conceptual overview of Git but it does not explain how it can be used in research projects.</p>

<li><p>Develop and maintain training material on software best practices for researchers that already write code. The CodeRefinery lessons address all academic disciplines and try to be as programming language-independent as possible.</p></li>
<li><p>Provide a <a class="reference external" href="https://coderefinery.org/repository/">code repository hosting service</a> that is open and free for all researchers based in universities and research institutes from Nordic countries.</p></li>
<li><p>Provide training opportunities in the Nordics using Carpentries and CodeRefinery training materials.</p></li>
<li><p>Articulate and implement the CodeRefinery sustainability plan.</p></li>

<h4>CodeRefinery audience<a class="headerlink" href="#coderefinery-audience" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>CodeRefinery workshops differ from Carpentry workshops as the audience is assumed to already write code and scripts and we aim at teaching them <strong>best software practices</strong>.</p>
<p>CodeRefinery learners usually do not have a good overview of <strong>best software practices</strong> but are aware of the need to learn them. Very often, they know the tools (Git, Jupyter, etc.) we are teaching but have difficulties to make the best use of them in their software development workflow.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">Competent practitioners</p>
<p>CodeRefinery learners can be qualified as <strong>competent practitioners</strong> because they already have an understanding of their needs.

<p>We don’t have to worry about details in the infographic above, it’s just to show that there’s no single theory of learning. Different disciplines organise how we process and retain knowledge in various ways, and with multiple types of learning, multiple theories are relevant. Learning theories help us structure what we know and guide us toward effective learning. This lesson focuses on a few key concepts that are easy to translate into concrete actions in a learning environment.</p>

<h3>What you will learn here<a class="headerlink" href="#what-you-will-learn-here" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>ENCCS, CodeRefinery and The Carpentries all teach computational competences to learners through
an applied approach founded on research-based teaching principles.
Usually, we avoid the theoretical and general in favor of the practical and specific. By
showing learners how to solve specific problems with specific tools and providing hands-on
practice, we develop learners’ confidence and empower them to start applying new knowledge
immediately.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Learners need to practice what they are learning in real time and get <strong>feedback</strong> on what they are doing. That is why the teaching approach relies on <strong>live coding</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Learners best learn in a respectful and motivating classroom environment, so it’s important to use a <strong>Code of Conduct</strong> and avoid certain demotivating language.</p></li>
<li><p>Learners are encouraged to <strong>help each other and collaborate</strong> during workshops as this improves their confidence and reinforces concepts taught.</p></li>

through distinct stages through practice and formal instruction. In simplified form, the three stages of this model are:</p>

<p>As will be further discussed in the episode on <a class="reference internal" href="#document-lesson-design"><span class="std std-doc">Lesson design</span></a>,

<h3>Cognitive development and mental models<a class="headerlink" href="#cognitive-development-and-mental-models" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Effective learning is facilitated by the creation of a well-founded <em>mental model</em>.
<strong>A mental model may be represented as a collection of concepts and facts, connected by relationships.</strong>
The mental model of an expert in any given subject will be far larger and more complex than that of a
novice, including both more concepts and more detailed and numerous relationships. However, both may
be perfectly useful in certain contexts.</p>
<div class="admonition-example-mental-model callout admonition" id="callout-0">
<p class="admonition-title">Example mental model</p>
<p>A long-time European resident may have an
advanced understanding of the location of European countries, major cities and landmarks, weather patterns, regional economies and demographic patterns, as well as the relationships
among these, compared with their understanding of these relationships for other countries.
In other words, their mental model of Europe is more complex compared with their mental model
of other continents.</p>
</div>
<p><img alt="Mental Models" src="_images/mental_models.png" /></p>
<p>We can distinguish between a <em>novice</em> and a <em>competent practitioner</em> (and an <em>expert</em>!) for a given domain based
on the complexity of their mental models.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>A <em>novice</em></strong> has a minimal mental model of surface features of the domain. Inaccuracies based on limited prior knowledge may interfere with adding new information. Predictions are likely to borrow heavily from mental models of other domains which seem superficially similar. One sign that someone is a novice is that their questions are “<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_even_wrong">not even wrong</a>”.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>A <em>competent</em></strong> practitioner has a mental model that is useful for everyday purposes. Most new information they are likely to encounter will fit well with their existing model. Even though many potential elements of their mental model may still be missing or wrong, predictions about their area of work are usually accurate.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>An <em>expert</em></strong> has a densely populated and connected mental model that is especially good for problem solving. They quickly connect concepts that others may not see as being related. They may have difficulty explaining how they are thinking in ways that do not rely on other features unique to their own mental model.</p></li>

<section id="concept-maps">
<h4>Concept maps<a class="headerlink" href="#concept-maps" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>Most people do not naturally visualize a mental model as a diagram of concepts and relationships.
Mental models are complicated! Yet, visual representation of concepts and relationships can be a
useful way to explore and understand hidden features of a mental model.</p>
<p>A useful tool for exploring any network of concepts and relationships is a <strong>concept map</strong>.
A concept map asks you to identify which concepts are most relevant to a topic at hand and
to identify how they are connected.</p>

<h4>Integrating new knowledge<a class="headerlink" href="#integrating-new-knowledge" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>According to the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructivism_(philosophy_of_education)">constructivism</a> theory in education, learners do not acquire knowledge and
understanding by passively perceiving it but rather by constructing new understanding and knowledge
through experience and social discourse, <strong>integrating new information with what they already know</strong>.</p>
<p>We can understand this as adding new nodes and their connections to existing nodes
to their mental models. We should thus try to connect new concepts with existing knowledge
that we can assume the learners to have.</p>
</section>
<section id="meaning">
<h4>Meaning<a class="headerlink" href="#meaning" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>Memory retention is also improved when learners are required to <strong>attach meaning to new information

(e.g. why something happened) to promote learners to meaningfully organise new information.</p>

<section id="the-power-of-analogies">
<h4>The power of analogies<a class="headerlink" href="#the-power-of-analogies" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<p><strong>Good analogies</strong> can be extraordinarily useful when teaching, because they draw upon an
existing mental model to fill in another, speeding learning and making a memorable
connection. However, all analogies have limitations! If you choose to use an analogy, be sure
its usefulness outweighs its potential to generate misconceptions that may interfere with
learning.</p>

<section id="how-knowledge-gets-in-the-way">
<h4>How “knowledge” gets in the way<a class="headerlink" href="#how-knowledge-gets-in-the-way" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>Mental models are hardly ever built from scratch. Every learner comes to a topic with
some amount of information, ideas and opinions about the topic. This is true even in
the case where a learner can’t articulate their prior knowledge and beliefs.</p>
<p>In many cases, this prior knowledge is incomplete or inaccurate. Inaccurate beliefs
(“misconceptions”) can impede learning by making it more difficult for
learners to incorporate new, correct information into their mental models.
Correcting learners’ misconceptions is at least as important as presenting them with
correct information. Broadly speaking, misconceptions fall into three categories:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Simple factual errors</strong>. These are the easiest to correct.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Broken models</strong>. We can address these by having learners reason through examples to
see contradictions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Fundamental beliefs</strong>. These beliefs are deeply connected
to the learner’s social identity and are the hardest to change.</p></li>

<p>Expertise is more than just knowing more facts - an expert’s mental models are also much more densely connected (as we saw above). Having a greater connectivity of a mental model allows experts to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>See connections between two topics or ideas that no one else can see.</p></li>
<li><p>See a single problem in several different ways.</p></li>
<li><p>Know intuitively how to solve a problem, or “what questions to ask”.</p></li>
<li><p>Jump directly from a problem to its solution because there is a direct link between the two in<br />
their mind. Where a competent practitioner would have to reason “A therefore B therefore C
therefore … therefore F”, the expert can go from A to F in a single step (“A therefore F”).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>However, experts are often so familiar with their subject that they can no longer imagine what
it’s like to not see the world that way. They can thus be less able to teach the subject than
people with less expertise who still remember learning it themselves. This phenomenon is known
as the “expert blind spot” or the “expert awareness gap”.</p>
<p>The good news is that this impediment can be overcome by training! Experts can be highly effective as long as they <strong>learn to identify and correct for their own expert awareness gaps</strong>.</p>

<h4>Working with learning objectives<a class="headerlink" href="#working-with-learning-objectives" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>Lessons should have a clear <em>learning objectives</em> section.
Good learning objectives are quite specific about the intended effect of a lesson on its learners.
We should aim to create learning objectives that are specific, accurate, and informative for
both learners and instructors.</p>
<p>In practice, it’s best to start defining your target audience by answering to questions
such as:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>What is the expected educational or skill level of my audience?</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Have they been already exposed to the technologies I am planning to teach?</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>What tools do they already use?</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>What are the main issues they are currently experiencing?</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Once you clarified your target audience, it is useful to create
<strong>learner personas</strong>. This will help you during the development process by
providing concrete examples of potential learners showing up at your
workshops.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>For each <strong>learner persona</strong>, try to think of what is <strong>useful to them</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>What do they <strong>need</strong> to remember/understand/apply/analyse/evaluate/create (see Bloom’s taxonomy below).</p></li>
<li><p>Then, you create a sequence of exercises which test incrementally
progressing tasks and acquisition of the new skills.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, you write material to teach the gap between exercises.</p></li>

<p><a class="reference external" href="https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/blooms-taxonomy/">Bloom’s Taxonomy</a> is a framework for
thinking about learning that breaks progress down into discrete, hierarchical steps.
While many ideas have come and gone in education, Bloom’s has remained a useful tool for educators,
in particular because the
hierarchy seems to be reasonably valid: outcomes at the top of the hierarchy cannot be achieved
without mastery of outcomes at
the bottom.</p>

<h3>Memory management<a class="headerlink" href="#memory-management" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Learning involves memory. For our purposes, human memory can be divided into two different
layers, <strong>long-term</strong> and  <strong>short-term</strong>.
Long-term memory, which we use to store persistent information, is essentially unbounded but is
slow to access. Short-term memory (also called working memory), which we use to actively think
about things, is much faster but also much smaller. It has been estimated that the average
adult’s short-term memory can hold 7±2 items for a few seconds before things start to drop out.</p>

<p>If we present our learners with large amounts
of information, without giving them the opportunity to practice using it (and thereby
transfer it into long-term memory), they will not retain the material as well as if we
present small amounts of information interspersed with practice opportunities.</p>
<p>When designing lessons we can try to maximise memory retention through a number of strategies:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Chunking</strong>: Our minds can store larger numbers of facts in short-term memory by creating
chunks, or relationships among separate items, allowing them to be remembered as a single
item. Connecting information makes it easier to remember.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Formative assessment to support memory consolidation</strong>: Formative assessment helps
learners solidify their understanding and begin transferring ideas into long-term memory.
Limitations of short-term memory are one reason why assessments should be frequent: short-term memory is limited not only in space, but also in time.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Group work</strong>: Elaboration (explaining your work) supports transfer to long-term
memory. This is one reason why teaching is one of the most effective ways to learn! Group
work can feel uncomfortable at first and consumes time in a workshop, but learners often
rate group work as a high point for both enjoyment and learning in a workshop.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Opportunities for reflection</strong>: Reflection is another tool that can help learners review
things they have learned, strengthen connections between them, and consolidate long-term
memories. Asking learners for feedback can be an effective consolidating prompt as providing
feedback demands some reflection on what has been learned.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Counting new concepts</strong>:  It is important to limit the number of concepts introduced in a lesson, but
this can be hard! Planning your lesson with a concept map can help you not only identify key
concepts and relationships, but also to notice when you are trying to teach too many things at
once.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition-formative-and-summative-assessment callout admonition" id="callout-0">
<p class="admonition-title">Formative and summative assessment</p>
<p><em>Formative assessment</em> takes place during teaching and learning. It sounds like
a fancy term, but it can be used to describe any interaction or activity
that provides <strong>feedback to both instructors and learners about learners’ level of understanding</strong>
of the material. For learners, this feedback can help focus their study efforts. For instructors, it
allows them to refocus their instruction to respond to challenges that learners are facing.
Used continuously.</p>
<p><em>Summative assessment</em> is used to judge whether a learner has reached an acceptable level of competence.
Usually, at the end of a course learners either “pass” or “fail” a summative assessment.</p>

<h3>Designing formative assessment<a class="headerlink" href="#designing-formative-assessment" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Well designed formative assessment tasks – i.e. quick questions and exercises –
can go a long way towards correcting misconceptions and expanding the mental models of learners.</p>
<p>Here are some suggestions to keep in mind when designing exercises:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Not every exercise has to be an amazing hand-on example. Mixing with smaller, more conceptual
things can reduce <a class="reference external" href="https://enccs.github.io/instructor-training/interactive-teaching/#cognitive-load">cognitive load</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Try to make your exercises relevant, meaningful and connected to previous knowledge.
Connect the exercises to the real world. When learners understand the meaning of new concepts
it will be easier for them to remember.</p></li>
<li><p>Create more involved exercises that can be optional for more advanced learners.
This is a way to meet the needs of participants with a wide range of background knowledge.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition-good-exercises-are-the-most-important-factor-in-a-good-lesson callout admonition" id="callout-1">
<p class="admonition-title">Good exercises are the most important factor in a good lesson</p>
<p>Even if you are preparing the rest of
the lesson mostly alone, consider a good long brainstorming session to go from “list of topics to
cover” to “sequence of exercises”.</p>
</div>
<p>When you are stuck thinking “how can I make an exercise that covers X”, look through the lists below for
inspiration. Not every exercise has to be an sophisticated hands-on thing, so don’t be afraid to use
different types:</p>
<p><strong>Types of exercises</strong>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Multiple choice (easy to get feedback via a classroom tool; try to design each wrong answer so that it identifies a specific misconception).</p></li>
<li><p>Code yourself (traditional programming).</p></li>
<li><p>Code yourself + multiple choice to see what the answer is (allows you to get feedback).</p></li>
<li><p>Minimal fix (given broken code, make it work).</p></li>
<li><p>Parsons problems (working solution but lines in random order, learner must “only” put them in proper order).</p></li>
<li><p>Fill in the blank, <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worked-example_effect">faded problems</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Tracing execution.</p></li>
<li><p>Tracing values through code flow.</p></li>
<li><p>Reverse execution (find input that gives an output).</p></li>
<li><p>Theme and variations (working code, adapt to other type of situation/problem).</p></li>
<li><p>Refactoring.</p></li>
<li><p>Draw a diagram.</p></li>
<li><p>Label diagram.</p></li>
<li><p>Matching problem: two sets of Q/A, match them.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip</strong>:</p>
<p>When designing exercises, consider that some participants will get stuck
and may want to re-join at a later exercise. In other words it is nice
if exercises build up on each other but not at the cost that if participants
get stuck at exercise 2, they will not be able to do exercises 3 to N.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">Using formative assessment to identify misconceptions</p>
<p>Formative assessment can be used to tease out misconceptions using for example multiple choice
questions (MCQ). When designed carefully, MCQs can target anticipated misconceptions with surgical
precision.</p>
<p>For example, suppose we are teaching children multi-digit addition. A well-designed MCQ could be:</p>
<p>Q: what is 27 + 15 ?</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>a) 42</p></li>
<li><p>b) 32</p></li>
<li><p>c) 312</p></li>

</ul>
<p>What misconceptions do the wrong answers reveal?</p>
<div class="admonition-solution solution important dropdown admonition" id="solution-0">
<p class="admonition-title">Solution</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>If the child answers 32, they are throwing away the carry completely.</p></li>
<li><p>If they answer 312, they know that they cannot just discard the carried ‘1’, but do not understand that it is actually a ten and needs to be added into the next column. In other words, they are treating each column of numbers as unconnected to its neighbors.</p></li>
<li><p>If they answer 33 then they know they have to carry the 1, but are carrying it back into the same column it came from.</p></li>

<li><p>most of the time they know their codes can run on HPC (from the documentation) but never really had the opportunity to try it out.</p></li>
<li><p>Very few will have their own codes where they may have tried different things to speed it up (threading, task parallelism) but have no clear strategy.</p></li>

<p><strong>Learner persona</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Sonya is a 1st year PhD student: she recently moved to Oslo and joined the
Computational and Systems Neuroscience group. She will be using the
<a class="reference external" href="https://nest-simulator.readthedocs.io/">NEST</a>, a simulator for spiking
neural network model. She used NEST during her master thesis but on her
small cluster: <strong>she never used an HPC resource</strong> and is really excited about it.</p></li>
<li><p>Robert is a field ecologist who obtained his PhD 6 months ago. He is now
working on a new project with Climate scientists and as a consequence will
need to run global climate models. He is <strong>not very familiar with command
line</strong> even though he attended a Software Carpentry workshop and the idea to
use HPC is a bit terrifying. He knows that he will get support from his
team who has extensive experience with HPC but would like to become more
independent and be able to <strong>run his own simulations</strong> (rather than copying
existing cases).</p></li>
<li><p>Jessica is a postdoc working on a project that investigates numerically the
complex dynamics arising at the tip of a fluid-driven rupture. Fluid
dynamics will be computed by a finite element method solving the
compressible Navier-Stokes equations on a moving mesh. She <strong>uses a code she
has developed</strong> during her PhD and that is based on existing libraries. She
has mostly ran it on a local desktop; her work during her PhD was very
limited due to the lack of computing resources and she is now very keen is
<strong>moving to HPC</strong>; she knows that it will requires some work, in particular to
parallelize her code. This HPC training will be her first experience with
HPC.</p></li>

<h3>Cognitive load<a class="headerlink" href="#cognitive-load" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Memory is not the only cognitive resource that is limited. Attention is constrained as well, which
can limit the information that enters short term memory in the first place as well as interfere with
consolidating into long-term memory.<br />
Many people believe that they can “multi-task”, but the reality is that
attention can only focus on one thing at a time. Adding items that demand attention adds more things
to alternate between, which can reduce efficiency and performance on all of them.<br />
While there was a brief interest in 2010s in the studies of learning by the “digital natives”
– generation born in an age of omnipresent digital media –
the hypothesis about their ability to multitask effectively also seems likely to be proven false
(see e.g. <a class="reference external" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tate.2017.06.001">Kirschner</a>).</p>
<p>There are different theories of cognitive load. In one of these, <a class="reference external" href="https://doi.org/10.1207/s15516709cog1202_4">Sweller posits</a>
that people have to attend to three types of things when they are learning:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Things they have to think about in order to <strong>perform a task</strong> (“intrinsic”).</p></li>
<li><p>Mental effort required to <strong>connect the task</strong> to new and old information (“germane”).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Distractions</strong> and other mental effort not directly related to performing or learning from the task (“extraneous”).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Cognitive load is not always a bad thing! There is plenty of evidence that some difficulty is
desirable and can increase learning. However, there are limits. Managing all forms of cognitive
load, with particular attention to extraneous load, can help prevent <strong>cognitive overload</strong> from
impeding learning altogether.</p>

<h3>Live demos and type-along sessions<a class="headerlink" href="#live-demos-and-type-along-sessions" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>One way to manage cognitive load as tasks become more complex is by using guided practice: creating
a structure that narrowly guides focus on specific skills and knowledge in a stepped fashion, with
feedback at each step before transferring attention to a new feature.</p>
<p>Worked examples, i.e. step-by-step demonstrations of how to perform particular tasks,<br />
can <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worked-example_effect#Faded_worked_examples">reduce cognitive load</a>
as they provide the scaffolding needed for learners to transfer
knowledge from working memory to long-term memory. Type-along sessions are particularly useful
as learners get to develop their “muscle memory” while the instructor slowly walks through
and explains each step. Splitting the task into well defined steps also helps learners
see the underlying structure of a problem and how it can be transferred to other types of
problems.</p>
<p>Exercises which learners should solve by themselves can build on the type-along
sessions but with some of the scaffolding removed so that they need to complete some
problem steps (faded examples).</p>
<section id="stick-to-the-script">
<h4>Stick to the script<a class="headerlink" href="#stick-to-the-script" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>Learning can be enhanced by combining multiple information sources, for example by showing
a piece of code (or a graphic or list of bullet points) while explaining it aloud.
But make sure to stick to the script!
Conflicting information splits the attention and leads to unnecessary cognitive load.</p>

<section id="copy-pasting-vs-manual-typing">
<h4>Copy-pasting vs manual typing<a class="headerlink" href="#copy-pasting-vs-manual-typing" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>Manually typing out code into a programming environment takes significantly longer time than
copy-pasting it from lesson material, but learners usually strongly prefer it. Typing out
every single code covered in a workshop might be too much, but instructors should try to
manually write out as much as is reasonable to do.</p>

<p>It takes work to actively assess mental models throughout a workshop; this also takes time. This can

think.</p>
<section id="expert-awareness-gap">
<h4>Expert awareness gap<a class="headerlink" href="#expert-awareness-gap" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>Because your learners’ mental models will likely be less densely connected than your own, a
conclusion that seems obvious to you will not seem that way to your learners. It is important to
explain what you are doing step-by-step, and how each step leads to the next one.</p>
<p>Note that the expert awareness gap is also referred to as “expert blind spot”.</p>

<section id="taking-advantage-of-errors">
<h4>Taking advantage of errors<a class="headerlink" href="#taking-advantage-of-errors" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>Experts can quickly diagnose errors which may seem cryptic to novices or competent practitioners.
If faced with an error message while teaching, an expert will often automatically diagnose and solve
a problem before a novice has even finished reading the error message. Because of this, it is very
important while teaching to be explicit about the process you are using to engage with errors, even if
they seem trivial to you, as they often will.</p>
<p>When faced with an error message, take the time to explain what happened and how the error message
can be understood. This will not only teach learners to understand and read stack traces, but also
give them confidence from seeing that even an expert makes mistakes!</p>

<section id="keeping-learners-motivated">
<h3>Keeping learners motivated<a class="headerlink" href="#keeping-learners-motivated" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>People learn best when they care about a topic and believe they can master it with a reasonable
investment of time and effort. A distinction is often made between <strong>extrinsic motivation</strong>,
which we feel when we do something to avoid punishment or earn a reward, and <strong>intrinsic motivation</strong>,
which is what we feel when we find something personally fulfilling.</p>
<p>According to <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-determination_theory">self-determination theory</a>,
the three drivers of intrinsic motivation are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Competence</strong>: the feeling that you know what you’re doing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Autonomy</strong>: the feeling of being in control of your own destiny.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Relatedness</strong>: the feeling of being connected to others.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Well-designed lessons and teaching encourage all three.</p>
<p><strong>Belonging</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>It’s been estimated that nearly 70% of individuals will experience
signs and symptoms of impostor syndrome at least once in their life! Research shows that
this phenomenon is not uncommon for students who enter a new academic environment.</p></li>
<li><p>If learners feel that they belong and are accepted in a learning environment they will
be more motivated to learn.</p></li>
<li><p>Having, discussing, and enforcing a Code of Conduct provides a framework for positive
communication to occur.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Invite Participation</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Encourage learners to learn from each other. Working in pairs or in groups encourages learners to
talk through their learning process, reinforcing memory and making it more likely that confusion
will be expressed and resolved. This can also address challenges of varying background experience:
asking more advanced learners to help beginners can maximize learning for both. In these cases,
make sure the beginner is doing the typing!</p></li>
<li><p>Acknowledging when learners are confused. Acknowledging and exploring confusion with kindness
rewards learners for sharing vulnerable information. Formative assessments can pinpoint misunderstandings. When learners see that
others are confused, they are more likely to share their own uncertainties.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Any questions?</strong></p>
<p>Instructor may accidentally dismiss learner confusion by asking for questions in a way that
reveals that they do not actually expect that anyone will have them.
Instead of asking “Does anyone have any questions?” and then quickly moving on,
consider asking instead “What questions do you have?” and leaving a good pause for
consideration. This establishes an expectation that people will, indeed, have questions, and
should challenge themselves to formulate them.</p>
<p><strong>Do no harm!</strong></p>
<p>Here are a few things you should not do in your workshop:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Talk contemptuously or with scorn about any tool or practice, or the people who use them.
Regardless of its shortcomings, many of your learners may be using that tool, and may have invested many years in learning to do so.</p></li>
<li><p>Dive into complex or detailed technical discussion with the one or two people in the audience who
clearly don’t actually need to be there. Reserve those conversations for breaks or follow-up emails.</p></li>
<li><p>Pretend to know more than you do. People will actually trust you more if you are frank about the
limitations of your knowledge, and will be more likely to ask questions and seek help.</p></li>
<li><p>Use the J word (“just”) or other demotivating words. Experts sometimes want to convey that
a task is as easy as they think it is, but these signal to the learner that the instructor thinks
their problem is trivial.</p></li>
<li><p>Take over the learner’s keyboard. It is rarely a good idea to type anything for your learners.
Doing so can be demotivating for the learner (as it implies you don’t think they can do it themselves or that you don’t want to wait for them). It also wastes a valuable opportunity for your learner to develop muscle memory and other skills that are essential for independent work.</p></li>
<li><p>Express surprise at unawareness. Saying things like “I can’t believe you don’t know X” or “You’ve
never heard of Y?” signals to the learner that they do not have some required pre-knowledge of the
material you are teaching, that they don’t belong at the workshop, and it may prevent them from
asking questions in the future.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Does your motivation matter?</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Learners respond to an instructor’s enthusiasm. The more motivated you are, the more motivated
they will be!</p></li>
<li><p>Instructors are learning to teach. This also takes motivation. Deliberative practice, seeking
feedback, and reflecting on mistakes in the context of your own busy work life is a challenge.
What will keep you energised to stay engaged with your learning process?</p></li>

<h4>Shared workshop document<a class="headerlink" href="#shared-workshop-document" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>Questions and frequent feedback is very important for interactive workshops,
but questions in the main room don’t scale to large rooms. Also, it’s likely
that only a few (extroverted) participants will do most of the talking while others
will not feel as comfortable speaking up.</p>
<p>A strategy shared by the Carpentries, CodeRefinery and ENCCS is to use a shared workshop
document where learners can ask questions on the fly. The document can also be used to
collect all relevant information for a workshop, including links to material and technical
instructions, as well as for formative assessment questions and notes from group work.
Out of many possible platforms, ENCCS uses <a class="reference external" href="https://hackmd.io/">HackMD</a>.
If you’re able to self-host a lightweight virtual machine, you might want to consider <a class="reference external" href="https://hedgedoc.org/">HedgeDoc</a> instead.</p>
<p>Some features of HackMD and how it compares to other modes of communication:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Chat is not good enough, you can’t easily reply to old things and finding earlier information is difficult.</p></li>
<li><p>HackMD allows threaded replies and follow up later.</p></li>
<li><p>You need some other instructors/helpers to watch HackMD and provide answers, bring
relevant questions to your attention, and let you know how things are going.</p></li>
<li><p>Learners can ask anonymously.</p></li>
<li><p>Learners don’t have to worry about interrupting the flow.</p></li>
<li><p>The document stays online and can be revisited by learners to remind themselves of valuable Q&amp;A
and discussions.</p></li>
<li><p>Disadvantage: can produce cognitive overload, warn people to not follow it too closely.</p></li>
<li><p>With too few people, it can turn out to be very quiet.</p></li>

<h4>Breaking the ice<a class="headerlink" href="#breaking-the-ice" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>A shared workshop document is useful to get learners engaged in a workshop from the start,
and also for breaking down social barriers and facilitating networking in groups.</p>
<p>Some strategies for icebreaker questions:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Use both social and scientific/professional icebreaker sessions.</p></li>
<li><p>Have breakout rooms in small groups to complete a small social task, multiple times with new groups.</p></li>
<li><p>Alternatively, start every day with an icebreaking activity in new breakout rooms to be used that day.</p></li>

<h3>Team teaching<a class="headerlink" href="#team-teaching" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Demonstration-based teaching requires two different types of focus:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Doing the mechanical steps as a demonstration;</p></li>
<li><p>Explaining why you are doing it.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This is a lot for one person to keep in mind, so can multiple people
work together for this? Team teaching idea:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>One person is doing the demonstrations.</p></li>
<li><p>One person is giving the commentary about what is done or what is seen.</p></li>
<li><p>The lecture becomes a discussion between two people instead.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition-co-teaching callout admonition" id="callout-0">
<p class="admonition-title">Co-teaching</p>
<p>Wikipedia: Co-teaching or team teaching is the division of labor
between educators to plan, organize, instruct and make assessments
on the same group of students, generally in the a common
classroom, and often with a strong focus on those teaching as a
team complementing one another’s particular skills or other
strengths.</p>
</div>
<p>Advantages:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The course seems very interactive, much more so than expecting
students to speak up.  The co-teacher can take on the “voice of the
audience”.</p></li>
<li><p>Shorter preparation time since co-teachers can rely on each other in
unexpected situations.</p></li>
<li><p>One co-teacher can be effectively learning at the same time and thus
acting as the “voice of the audience” in another way.</p></li>
<li><p>Great way to onboard new instructors – extensive training and
preparation less needed.</p></li>
<li><p>More active minds means better ability to watch and react to other
feedback, such as HackMD or chat.</p></li>
<li><p>Less workload – one person does not have to prepare perfectly, any
uncertainty can usually be quickly answered by the other.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Disadvantages:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Requires two people’s time.</p></li>
<li><p>Requires coordination when preparing (slows down preparation somewhat).</p></li>
<li><p>Unfamiliar concept to most people.</p></li>

<h4>Strategies<a class="headerlink" href="#strategies" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>In reality, these strategies are mixed and matched even within a
lesson, and there are many things between these:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>One person gives lectures, one does the typing during demos.</p></li>
<li><p>“Interview”: One primarily doing the “teaching”, one guiding by
asking questions, either as an interviewer or as a virtual learner.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Things that don’t work (are <strong>not</strong> team teaching):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Dividing up a lesson into parts, where each person gives different parts
independently.</p></li>

<h3>Workshop host and facilitator<a class="headerlink" href="#workshop-host-and-facilitator" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facilitation_(organisational)">Facilitation</a> is a process for <strong>helping
other people dealing with a process or reach an agreement or solution</strong> - without getting directly involved in
the process, discussion, etc. oneself. It can also be seen as the art of <strong>moving a group of people through
meetings, planning sessions, or training, and successfully achieving a specific goal</strong>.</p>
<p>Since training workshops are often delivered by multiple trainers, exercise leaders and helpers, it can be
extremely valuable to have a <em>workshop host</em> who engages in facilitation activities throughout the workshop.
This can include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Providing a general introduction, welcome and description of the code of conduct at the beginning - setting the stage for a successful workshop.</p></li>
<li><p>Introduce all trainers and other contributors.</p></li>
<li><p>Introduce an ice-breaking activity to engage participants and establish a friendly and collaborative environment.</p></li>
<li><p>Give framing at the start of each section of the workshop and hand over the word to the relevant trainer.</p></li>
<li><p>Be observant to raised hands or other reactions in the audience, potential technical issues (poor audio, too small font size) and be prepared to jump in to raise issues to the trainer or invite questions.</p></li>
<li><p>Pay attention to the pace and quality of the training, and be prepared to ask for improvements in a welcoming way:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“I think this section was probably very complicated for most of our participants, would you mind going back and explaining again how you did X?”</p></li>
<li><p>“Sorry for interrupting, but this might be going too fast for those of us with limited background knowledge on this topic. Could you go a little slower?”</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Make sure that there is at least a 10 minute break every hour. Encourage participants to stand up, stretch their legs, grab some water or hot drink.</p></li>
<li><p>Update shared workshop document with information about the structure of the workshop - add instructions for exercises and how long they’ll last, how long the breaks last, add headings from training material to remind learners where we are, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure that questions in shared workshop document are answered, either by text by trainers not currently teaching, or by interrupting the trainer.</p></li>
<li><p>Give frequent “meta talk” in between sessions to help learners connect the teaching with the workshop structure.</p></li>
<li><p>Be the voice of the audience - pointing out when something was difficult, when something didn’t work well, what a commonly encountered challenge might be etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Moderate discussions, tactfully interrupting dialogues that become too advanced or off-topic, and make sure that everyone gets heard.</p></li>
<li><p>Invite and encourage questions, asking questions oneself to lower the barrier (but don’t ask advanced questions!).</p></li>
<li><p>Invite anonymous feedback in the shared workshop document.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Workshop hosts engaging in these facilitation activities can thus provide the glue to tie all components of a
workshop together, making the workshop feel more cohesive, inclusive, meaningful and enjoyable.</p>

<p>Our lessons are <strong>collaboratively developed</strong> and some are created by many

<p>Every so often, there is an extensive

<p class="admonition-title">Why code review?</p>
<p>In collaborative software development, it is standard practice to review each other’s
code changes. This serves multiple purposes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Others in the team learn about your changes.</p></li>
<li><p>An extra pair of eyes are useful to catch bugs or suggest improvements</p></li>
<li><p>It’s possible (and common) to enable <em>automated testing</em> so that each pull request is tested
automatically in the cloud so that the reviewer can see whether a pull request passes all
unit tests.</p></li>

<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Surveys: Discussed below</p></li>
<li><p>Plus one, minus one: After each day of a workshop (or after a module), ask participants to
name one thing they liked and one thing that could be improved.</p></li>

<h4>Notes<a class="headerlink" href="#notes" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>For extended workshop (full day/ 2 half-days), good place to split is after “Lesson design” episode and subsequent practice on backwards design.</p></li>
<li><p>For extended or practical-first workshop, participants could also be encouraged to come up with a topic of a (short) presentation in advance, to be used in backwards-design and teaching/feedback practice sessions.</p></li>
<li><p>First two outcomes are related to ENCCS material, but even so it can be used (skipping introduction) as a good example implementation of the concepts covered. Rest of the content is generally applicable to any HPC-related training.</p></li>

<h3>Addressing preconceptions<a class="headerlink" href="#addressing-preconceptions" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>As noted in the Introduction, the workshop primarily targets competent practitioners and experts that might want (or need) to teach their knowledge to others. This implies that most of them already have their own ways of understanding, structuring and probably even presenting relevant material, as well as selected tools and usage habits. Several concepts of this lesson may appear unusual or overhead-inducing at first glance.
It might be useful to prepare an example of unique advantage for each such concept/technique that distinguishes it from the alternatives. Some suggestions (feel free to come up with your own or tailor them to your needs):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Backwards design</strong> can significantly speed up initial development or major update of teaching resources, because it shifts focus from what to teach/present to what the participants are supposed to learn. This way individual contributors can choose the content that reflects their own expertise, easily exchange domain examples when preparing for specific audience, etc.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Interactive teaching</strong> combines best qualities of lectures and exercise sessions widely used in academic education: precise amount of content is presented by an expert and then immediately supported by demonstration or direct application while the knowledge is fresh. Constant feedback also allows to adjust teaching speed and fix small issues at once and not “next time”, after reading exit polls.</p></li>
<li><p>Even if you consider certain subject matter “your child”, <strong>collaborative development</strong> may allow you to reach larger and more diverse audiences at the fraction of effort, such as adapting setup and execution instructions for a local HPC installation by an on-site administrator.</p></li>

<span id="learner-personas"></span><h2>Who is the course for?<a class="headerlink" href="#who-is-the-course-for" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Teaching is a profession, but also something that everyone needs to be
able to do to some degree, since everyone has their own personal
specialties they will either teach or mentor.</p>
<p>This course can be relevant for different learner personas:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>You run a practical teaching program</strong> at your institution (for example
as part of a research computing group) and would like to learn best
practices for collaborative teaching of technical topics, so that you aren’t re-inventing
the same thing over and over again.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>You are a technical specialist</strong> who is frustrated with the way you
currently try to teach others who need to use your software or
infrastructure.  You can’t spend too much time to become a
professional, but you know you need something more than what you’ve
been doing.  Thus, you would like to adopt some of the best practices of
designing and teaching interactive, hands-on workshops.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>You’ve been teaching alone</strong>, but would like to join a collaboration
network for more co-teaching and to reduce the amount of duplication
of effort.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>You are interested in teaching ENCCS own lessons</strong>, and would like a
comprehensive kick-start to how our workshops work – either to join us,
or teach our lessons with us or independently.</p></li>
