## Backwards lesson design

### The approach

- You don't think about how to do something and try to explain it.
- Avoid the typical approach *"I want to show a number of things which I think are cool about
  tool X - how do I press these into 90 minutes?"*
- Instead, you start with **learner personas**, and think of what is
  **useful to them**: *"What do I want **them** to be able to remember/understand/apply/analyze/evaluate/create?"*.
  Then, you create a sequence of exercises which test
  incrementally progressing tasks.
- Then, you write the minimum amount
  of material to teach the gap between exercises.


### The process

For the whole process, see [our
manual](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/lesson-design/#backwards-lesson-design)
(instructor discusses these points briefly).


### Why is it good to have a process?:

- Having a semi-rigid design process can **save time** to start drafting.
- It will probably **increase quality and relevance** of lessons for learners.
- **We aren't perfect yet.**  CodeRefinery is still striving to get
  better at this, and we are more ad-hoc than you might think.
  A number of our lessons have not been designed this way but we are now improving
  these lessons with the backwards lesson design in mind.


### Designing exercises

When designing exercises, consider that some participants will get stuck
and may want to re-join at a later exercise. In other words it is nice
if exercises build up on each other but not at the cost that if participants
get stuck at exercise 2, they will not be able to do exercises 3 to N.

## Example

We need to add an example here ...

## Practice backwards design

> ## Exercise
>
> Choose a simple lesson topic and apply backwards lesson design.  You
> won't get all the way through, but come up with a logical
> progression of exercises.
>
> Some suggestions:
> - Regular expressions
> - Making papers in LaTeX
> - Making figures in your favorite programming language
> - Linux shell basics
> - Something non-technical, such as painting a room
> - An instructor training for CodeRefinery
> - Some aspect from an already existing lesson
> - [Introduction to high-performance computing](https://hpc-carpentry.github.io/hpc-intro/) (or an episode therein)
> - [Unix shell in a HPC context](https://hpc-carpentry.github.io/hpc-shell/) (or an episode therein)
> - A lesson you always wanted to teach
>
> Exercise (30 minutes):
> - Collect notes in a shared document.
> - Start with learner personas and learning outcomes.
> - Come up with a logical progression of exercises.
>
> Discussion (15 minutes):
> - How does this approach compare to other lessons or courses you have designed?
> - We read, compare, and discuss our notes.
