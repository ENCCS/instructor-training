## The importance of going slow

It takes work to actively assess mental models throughout a workshop; this also takes time. This can 
make Instructors feel conflicted about using formative assessment routinely. However, the need to 
conduct routine assessment is not the only reason why a workshop should proceed more slowly than you 
think.

Because your learners' mental models will likely be less densely connected than your own, a 
conclusion that seems obvious to you will not seem that way to your learners. It is important to 
explain what you are doing step-by-step, and how each step leads to the next one.

### Taking advantage of errors

Experts can quickly diagnose errors which may seem cryptic to novices or competent practitioners. 
If faced with an error message while teaching, an expert will often automatically diagnose and solve 
a problem before a novice has even finished reading the error message. Because of this, it is very important while teaching to be explicit about the process you are using to engage with errors, even if they seem trivial to you, as they often will.

When faced with an error message because of a typo, logical mistake or whatever, take the time to 
explain what happened and how the error message can be understood. This will not only teach learners 
to understand and read stack traces, but also give them confidence from seeing that even an expert 
makes mistakes!

### Expert awareness gap 

Because your learners’ mental models will likely be less densely connected than your own, a 
conclusion that seems obvious to you will not seem that way to your learners. It is important to 
explain what you are doing step-by-step, and how each step leads to the next one.

Note that the expert awareness gap is also referred to as "expert blind spot". 

### Meta-talk

Don't just teach, also make sure you guide the learners through the
course.

- You know what you just discussed, and what is coming next, but
  learners are often stuck thinking about what is happening right now.
- Give a lot of "meta-talk" that is not just about the topic you are
  teaching, but how you are teaching it.
- Examples
  - **Why** you are doing each episode
  - What is the purpose of each exercise
  - Clearly state what someone should accomplish in each exercise and
    how long it will take - don't assume this is obvious.
  - What is the point of each lesson.  How much should people expect
    to get from it?  Should you follow everything, or are some things
    advanced and optional?  Make that clear.

## Live demos and type-along sessions

Using worked examples, i.e. step-by-step demonstrations of how to perform particular tasks,  
can reduce cognitive load as they provide the scaffolding needed for learners to transfer 
knowledge from working memory to long-term memory. Type-along sessions are particularly useful 
as learners get to develop their "muscle memory" while the instructor slowly walks through 
and explains each step. Splitting the task into well defined steps also helps learners 
see the underlying structure of a problem and how it can be transferred to other types of 
problems.

Exercises which learners should solve by themselves can build on the type-along 
sessions but with some of the scaffolding removed so that they need to complete some 
problem steps independently (or in groups).

### Stick to the script

Learning can be enhanced by combining multiple information sources, for example by showing 
a piece of code (or a graphic or list of bullet points) while explaining it aloud. 
But make sure to stick to the script! 
Conflicting information splits the attention and leads to unnecessary cognitive load.

### Copy-pasting vs manual typing  

Manually typing out code into a programming environment takes significantly longer time than 
copy-pasting it from lesson material, but learners usually strongly prefer it. Typing out 
every single code covered in a workshop might be too much, but instructors should try to 
manually write out as much as is reasonable to do.

## Keeping learners motivated

**Belonging**

- It's been estimated that nearly 70\% of individuals will experience 
  signs and symptoms of impostor syndrome at least once in their life! Research shows that 
  this phenomenon is not uncommon for students who enter a new academic environment.
- If learners feel that they belong and are accepted in a learning environment they will 
  be more motivated to learn. 
- Having, discussing, and enforcing a Code of Conduct provides a framework for positive 
  communication to occur.


**Invite Participation**

- Encourage learners to learn from each other. Working in pairs or in groups encourages learners to 
  talk through their learning process, reinforcing memory and making it more likely that confusion 
  will be expressed and resolved. This can also address challenges of varying background experience: 
  asking more advanced learners to help beginners can maximize learning for both. In these cases, 
  make sure the beginner is doing the typing!
- Acknowledging when learners are confused. Acknowledging and exploring confusion with kindness 
  rewards learners for sharing vulnerable information. Formative assessments can pinpoint misunderstandings. When learners see that 
  others are confused, they are more likely to share their own uncertainties.

**Any questions?**

Instructor may accidentally dismiss learner confusion by asking for questions in a way that 
reveals that they do not actually expect that anyone will have them. 
Instead of asking "Does anyone have any questions?" and then quickly moving on, 
consider asking instead "What questions do you have?" and leaving a good pause for 
consideration. This establishes an expectation that people will, indeed, have questions, and 
should challenge themselves to formulate them.


**Do no harm!**  

Here are a few things you should not do in your workshop:

- Talk contemptuously or with scorn about any tool or practice, or the people who use them. 
  Regardless of its shortcomings, many of your learners may be using that tool, and may have invested many years in learning to do so. 
- Dive into complex or detailed technical discussion with the one or two people in the audience who 
  clearly don't actually need to be there. Reserve those conversations for breaks or follow-up emails.
- Pretend to know more than you do. People will actually trust you more if you are frank about the 
  limitations of your knowledge, and will be more likely to ask questions and seek help. 
- Use the J word ("just") or other demotivating words. Experts sometimes want to convey that 
  a task is as easy as they think it is, but these signal to the learner that the instructor thinks 
  their problem is trivial
- Take over the learner's keyboard. It is rarely a good idea to type anything for your learners. 
  Doing so can be demotivating for the learner (as it implies you don't think they can do it themselves or that you don't want to wait for them). It also wastes a valuable opportunity for your learner to develop muscle memory and other skills that are essential for independent work.
- Express surprise at unawareness. Saying things like "I can’t believe you don’t know X" or "You’ve 
  never heard of Y?" signals to the learner that they do not have some required pre-knowledge of the 
  material you are teaching, that they don’t belong at the workshop, and it may prevent them from 
  asking questions in the future.

**Does your motivation matter?**

- Learners respond to an instructor’s enthusiasm. The more motivated you are, the more motivated 
  they will be!
- Instructors are learning to teach. This also takes motivation. Deliberative practice, seeking 
  feedback, and reflecting on mistakes in the context of your own busy work life is a challenge. 
  What will keep you energized to stay engaged with your learning process?


## Good software practices

We shouldn't assume that all learners are aware of best software development 
practices. It is therefore a good idea to adhere to good software development practices when 
teaching workshops 
(e.g. by using version control and testing in code examples), so that participants  
become acquainted with them as a side benefit of attending a workshop.


## Team teaching

Demonstration-based teaching require two different types of focus:
- Doing the mechanical steps as a demonstration
- Explaining why you are doing it

This is a lot for one person to keep in mind, so can multiple people
work together for this? Team teaching idea:
- One person is doing the demonstrations
- One person is giving the commentary about what they are doing
- The lecture becomes a discussion between two people instead.

```{callout} Co-teaching

   Wikipedia: Co-teaching or team teaching is the division of labor
   between educators to plan, organize, instruct and make assessments
   on the same group of students, generally in the a common
   classroom,[1] and often with a strong focus on those teaching as a
   team complementing one another's particular skills or other
   strengths.
```

Advantages:
- The course seems very interactive, much more so than expecting
  students to speak up.  The co-teacher can take on the "voice of the
  audience".
- Quicker preparation time since co-teachers can rely on each other in
  unexpected situations.
- One co-teacher can be effectively learning at the same time and thus
  acting as the "voice of the audience" in another way.
- Great way to onboard new instructors - extensive training and
  preparation no longer needed.
- More active minds means better able to watch and react to other
  feedback, such as HackMD or chat.
- Less workload - one person does not have to prepare perfectly, any
  uncertainty can usually be quickly answered by the other.


Disadvantage:
- Requires two people's time
- Requires coordination when preparing (slows you down in preparation)
- Unfamiliar concept to most people

### Strategies

In reality, these strategies are mixed and matched even within a
lesson, and there are many things between these:

- One person gives lectures, one does the typing during demos.
- "Interview": One primarily doing the "teaching", one guiding by
  asking questions - either as an interviewer or as a virtual learner.

Things that don't work (are not team teaching):

- Dividing up a lesson into parts, each person gives different parts
  independently.

## Teaching mechanics 

The mechanics of online or in-person teaching is all about the tools and visual 
aspects of teaching. It is important to plan and prepare these technical 
aspects before a workshop.

- The learner has a *lot* more to think about than you do, so you need
  to minimize the possible distractions and unnecessary weirdness.
- A learner will often use only one small screen, limiting the number of
  things that they can focus on.
- You are must faster than learners. You have to do things to slow yourself down.


### Shell sharing

When doing any demonstration, there are difficulties:

- If one misses something, you can't rewind to see it - is there any
  way to catch up?
- The learner must get oriented with the whole picture, while
  instructor knows precisely where to focus.

A good **shell share** has some of the following properties:

- Large font
- Shell history, available separately from the main shell window
- Closely matches the type-along instructions

A collection of good practices for screen sharing your shell environment can be found  
[here](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/instructor-tech-setup/#terminal-history-window).

```{discussion}
The instructor will demonstrate several shell-sharing systems.  You
will use this in the teaching practice.
```


### Screen sharing

`````{discussion}

Look at the various [screen layouts in the CodeRefinery
manuals](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/instructor-tech-setup/#screen-sharing).
Use the HackMD to comment about what which are better or worse.

````{output} HackMD prototype

- Many learners will have a smaller screen than you.
- You should plan for learners with only one small screen.
- A learner will **need to focus on both your screen share and their
  work**.
- Sharing your a whole screen is almost always a bad idea, if you want
  the learners to do anything at the same time.
- If you constrict yourself, then your experience is more similar to
  that of a learner.

Vertical sharing:
- CodeRefinery has recently started trialing a **vertical share**
  system, where you share a vertical half of your screen.
- This allows learners with one screen to display your screen
  side-by-side with their learn
- Zoom provides a "Share a part of screen" that is good for this.


## Questions

- Questions are great, and important for any practical and interactive
  class
- But questions in main room doesn't scale to very large rooms.
- ENCCS strategy: HackMD for questions
  - Chat is not good enough, you can't reply to old things
  - HackMD allows threaded replies and follow up later
  - You need some other helpers to watch HackMD and answer, and bring
    things up to you.  And let you know how things are going.
  - Learners can ask anonymously
  - Learners don't have to worry about interrupting the flow.
  - Disadvantage: can produce information overload, warn people to not
    follow too closely
  - With too few people, it can turn out to be very quiet.
