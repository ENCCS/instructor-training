# Practice Teaching and Giving Feedback

Goals of this teaching practice:

- We will first practice giving **constructive feedback** on pre-recorded teaching.
- Then, in groups of 4-5 persons we will practice teaching a **5-minute segment
  of a lesson of your choice**.
- The section you pick should require **screen sharing** and be of some
  **demonstration or follow-along task** (preferably using a shell) to also
  practice having a good screen-sharing setup.
- We will practice improving our 5-minute segment by taking the feedback into account.
- In both session you can teach the same topic/segment but if you prefer you can also
  change the topic/aspect for the second session.

## Giving feedback for live coding examples

Teaching by live coding is a
[performance art which requires practice](https://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#s:performance).
These exercises aim at learning to give feedback. We will watch videos of (pretend) teaching and 
give feedback on two axes: positive vs. negative and content vs. presentation. 
We will use a [rubric](http://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/demos_rubric/) (used during 
The Carpentries teaching demos) to help take notes.

Each person in the class add one point to a 2x2 grid on a whiteboard or in the shared notes 
without duplicating any points.
For online instructor training event, use breakout room (4-5 persons per group) to facilitate discussion. Then each group reports to the shared notes.


```{challenge} Example 1
This exercise highlights some typical pitfalls that most instructors
fall into sooner or later, and also shows how to avoid them.
Watch closely since we will be giving feedback!
- Watch these two videos: [video 1](https://youtu.be/bXxBeNkKmJE) and
  [video 2](https://youtu.be/SkPmwe_WjeY)
- What was better in video 1 and what was better in video 2?
- Please give feedback in the shared workshop document in the 2x2 rubric.
```

```{challenge} (Optional) Example 2

As a group, we will watch [this video of teaching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ApVt04rB4U).
The instructor is making several mistakes, but can you also observe anything positive?

As before, give feedback on two axes: positive vs. negative and content vs. presentation. 
What did other people see that you missed? What did they think that you strongly agree or disagree with?
```

## Live coding practice

In group rooms, 50 minutes.

```{challenge}
- We organize the breakout rooms to not only discuss one lesson/topic so that it is more interesting
  to listen and also probably we will all get more useful feedback.
- Give each other **constructive verbal feedback** on the teaching demos, for example
  using [this demo rubric](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/demos_rubric/).
- Write down questions (in the collaborative document) that you would like to
  discuss in the main room or interesting conclusions which you would like to
  share with others.
```

## Discussion

```{discussion} Main room discussion
- We discuss questions and conclusions which came up during the group work session.
```
