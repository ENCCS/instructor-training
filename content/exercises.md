# Practice Teaching and Giving Feedback

Goals of this teaching practice:

- In groups of 4-5 persons we will practice teaching a **5-minute segment
  of a lesson of your choice**.
- The section you pick should require **screen sharing** and be of some
  **demonstration or follow-along task** (preferably using a shell) to also
  practice having a good screen-sharing setup.
- We will practice giving **constructive feedback**.
- We will practice improving our 5-minute segment by taking the feedback into account.
- In both session you can teach the same topic/segment but if you prefer you can also
  change the topic/aspect for the second session.

## Teaching demos 

In group rooms, 50 minutes.

```{challenge}
- We organize the breakout rooms to not only discuss one lesson/topic so that it is more interesting
  to listen and also probably we will all get more useful feedback.
- Give each other **constructive verbal feedback** on the teaching demos, for example
  using [this demo rubric](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/demos_rubric/).
- Write down questions (in the collaborative document) that you would like to
  discuss in the main room or interesting conclusions which you would like to
  share with others.
```

## Feedback for two live-coding examples

```{challenge}
Teaching by live coding is a
[performance art which requires practice](https://teachtogether.tech/#s:performance-exercises).
This exercise highlights some typical pitfalls that most instructors
fall into sooner or later, and also shows how to avoid them.
Watch closely since we will be giving feedback!
- Watch these two videos: [video 1](https://youtu.be/bXxBeNkKmJE) and
  [video 2](https://youtu.be/SkPmwe_WjeY)
- What was better in video 1 and what was better in video 2?
- Please give feedback in the shared workshop document.
```

### Getting/giving feedback on teaching

Teaching is a skill. One of the objective of this instructor training is to give 
you the confidence in teaching ENCCS lessons. Later we will have group work where we 
will practice teaching some lessons.

Before doing so, we will learn here to give feedback on teaching using the same 
positive-vs-negative and content-vs-presentation rubric.

> ## Give feedback on teaching (optional, 10 min)
> 
> This exercise aims at learning to give feedback. It is optional as we have 
> similar exercises when {doc}`practising teaching <exercises>`).
> As a group, we will watch [this video of teaching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ApVt04rB4U) and
> give feedback on two axes: positive vs. negative and content vs. presentation. Have each person in
> the class add one point to a 2x2 grid on a whiteboard or in the shared notes  (hackMD, etherpad, google doc) without duplicating any points.
> For online instructor training event, use breakout room (4-5 persons per group) to facilitate discussion. Then each group reports to the shared notes.
> You can use a [rubric](http://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/demos_rubric/) (used during The Carpentries teaching demos) to help you take notes.
> What did other people see that you missed? What did they think that you strongly agree or disagree with?
