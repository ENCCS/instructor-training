# Pre-workshop preparation


These things will help you get the most out of this workshop, by
giving you a broad overview at the beginning that you might only get
later on in the lesson.

Don't worry if you don't have time to do everything here.  The most
important ones are listed first.

## Read "How to help someone use a computer" (5 min)

[How to help someone use a computer, by Phil
Agre](https://www.librarian.net/stax/4965/how-to-help-someone-use-a-computer-by-phil-agre/).
Summary: Most of our teaching challenge is helping people to overcome bad user
interface design.


## Browse an ENNCS lesson (5 min)

Please take 5 minutes and go through an [ENCCS
lesson](https://enccs.se/lessons/) and understand the general
layout.  Don't go in-depth to any of the material (unless you want,
obviously). 


## Read "The science of learning" (20 min)

Read this short paper [The Science of
Learning](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/files/papers/science-of-learning-2015.pdf)
which provides a brief overview of some key evidence-based results in
teaching. This paper is also used by [The
Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) for their Instructor Training
workshops.

> ## Remark
>
> Don't worry if there are sections you do not understand. The main objective
> is to have a baseline for our discussions, not to check your ability to teach
> the lesson during the instructor training workshop.
