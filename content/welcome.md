- **Catalyze and form new networks** and collaborations of teachers and trainers of
  practical scientific computing.

### Giving confidence

> *Goal number one should be that we give participants the confidence to
> independently apply the tools or knowledge learnt. This is more important
> that giving a "complete" overview.* [Lucy Whalley gave this great comment at a CodeRefinery workshop]

- You don't have to know everything to use (or teach) something.
- For the large majority of topics we teach, there are many resources online
  which provide how-to guides or tutorials. And the Stack Overflow answer bank
  isn't getting any smaller. So we need to ask why do people attend in-person
  sessions if there is information freely available? Our impression is that
  it is for confidence building, identity formation, perhaps signposting to
  resources.
- This also links with building a welcoming/inclusive environment: for example,
  imposter syndrome, which disproportionately affects under-represented groups
  ([link](https://www.ncda.org/aws/NCDA/pt/sd/news_article/245005/_PARENT/CC_layout_details/false)),
  can manifest as low self-confidence --> building the confidence of
  students in the classroom may lead to a more diverse community.

## Code of Conduct

We strive to follow the Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct
to foster an inclusive and welcoming environment for everyone.

In short:

- Use welcoming and inclusive language
- Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accept constructive criticism

Furthermore, as this is a hands-on, interactive workshop:
- Be kind to each other and help each other as best you can.
- If you can't help someone or there is some problem, let someone know.
- If you notice something that prevents you from learning as well as you can, let us know and don't suffer silently.
- Also let us know about the "little things":
  - too low volume?
  - font size too small?
  - generally confusing instructor?
  - not enough breaks?
