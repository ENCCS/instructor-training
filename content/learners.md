## Who are your learners?

The first task in teaching is to figure out who your learners are. According to the 
[Dreyfus model of skill acquisition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_model_of_skill_acquisition) learners acquire skills and advance
through distinct stages through practice and formal instruction. In simplified form, the three stages of this model are:

### Novices, competent practitioners and experts

![Novice, Competent Practitioner, Expert](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/fig/skill-level.svg)

-   *Novice*: someone who doesn't know what they don't know, i.e.,
    they don't yet know what the key ideas in the domain are or how they relate.
    One sign that someone is a novice is that their questions "aren't even wrong".
-   *Competent practitioner*: someone who has enough understanding for everyday purposes. 
    They won't know all the details of how something works and their understanding may not
    be entirely accurate, but it is sufficient for completing normal tasks with normal 
    effort under normal circumstances.
-   *Expert*: someone who can easily handle situations that are out of the ordinary.

Participants in ENCCS workshops are usually *competent practitioners*. They already write 
code and know what additional tools or techniques they need to learn to accomplish their goals.

As will be further discussed in the episode on [Lesson design](lesson-design.md), 
it is important to clearly define the target audience of workshops, including their 
background knowledge and training needs.

## Cognitive development and mental models

Effective learning is facilitated by the creation of a well-founded *mental model*. 
A mental model is a collection of concepts and facts, along with the relationships 
between those concepts, which a person has about a topic. 

For example, a long-time European resident may have an 
advanced understanding of the location of European countries, major cities and landmarks, weather patterns, regional economies and demographic patterns, as well as the relationships 
among these, compared with their understanding of these relationships for other countries. 
In other words, their mental model of Europe is more complex compared with their mental model 
of other countries.

We can distinguish between a *novice* and a *competent practitioner* for a given domain based 
on the complexity of their mental models.

- A *novice* has a minimal mental model of surface features of the domain. Inaccuracies based on limited prior knowledge may interfere with adding new information. Predictions are likely to borrow heavily from mental models of other domains which seem superficially similar.
- A *competent* practitioner has a mental model that is useful for everyday purposes. Most new information they are likely to encounter will fit well with their existing model. Even though many potential elements of their mental model may still be missing or wrong, predictions about their area of work are usually accurate.
- An *expert* has a densely populated and connected mental model that is especially good for problem solving. They quickly connect concepts that others may not see as being related. They may have difficulty explaining how they are thinking in ways that do not rely on other features unique to their own mental model.

### Understanding new concepts

According to the [constructivism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructivism_(philosophy_of_education)) theory in education, learners do not acquire knowledge and 
understanding by passively perceiving it but rather by constructing new understanding and knowledge 
through experience and social discourse, **integrating new information with what they already know**.
We can understand this as adding new nodes and their connections to existing nodes 
to their mental models. We should thus try to connect new concepts with existing knowledge 
that we can assume the learners to have.

Memory retention is also improved when learners are required to **attach meaning to new information 
and reflect on why it is important**. Instructors can assign tasks which require explanation 
(e.g. why something happened) to promote learners to meaningfully organise new information.

**Good analogies** can be extraordinarily useful when teaching, because they draw upon an 
existing mental model to fill in another, speeding learning and making a memorable 
connection. However, all analogies have limitations! If you choose to use an analogy, be sure 
its usefulness outweighs its potential to generate misconceptions that may interfere with 
learning.


### How “knowledge” gets in the way

Mental models are hardly ever built from scratch. Every learner comes to a topic with
some amount of information, ideas and opinions about the topic. This is true even in
the case where a learner can’t articulate their prior knowledge and beliefs.

In many cases, this prior knowledge is incomplete or inaccurate. Inaccurate beliefs
("misconceptions") can impede learning by making it more difficult for
learners to incorporate new, correct information into their mental models. 
Correcting learners’ misconceptions is at least as important as presenting them with 
correct information. Broadly speaking, misconceptions fall into three categories:

- **Simple factual errors**. These are the easiest to correct.
- **Broken models**. We can address these by having learners reason through examples to
    see contradictions.
- **Fundamental beliefs**. These beliefs are deeply connected
    to the learner’s social identity and are the hardest to change.

## Cognitive load

Memory is not the only cognitive resource that is limited. Attention is constrained as well, which 
can limit the information that enters short term memory in the first place as well as interfere with 
attempts at consolidation. While many people believe that they can "multi-task", the reality is that 
attention can only focus on one thing at a time. Adding items that demand attention adds more things 
to alternate between attending to, which can reduce efficiency and performance on all of them.

There are different theories of cognitive load. In one of these, [Sweller posits](https://doi.org/10.1207/s15516709cog1202_4) that people have to attend to three types of things when they are learning:

- Things they have to think about in order to **perform a task** ("intrinsic").
- Mental effort required to **connect the task** to new and old information ("germane").
- **Distractions** and other mental effort not directly related to performing or learning from the task ("extraneous").

Cognitive load is not always a bad thing! There is plenty of evidence that some difficulty is 
desirable and can increase learning. However, there are limits. Managing all forms of cognitive 
load, with particular attention to extraneous load, can help prevent **cognitive overload** from 
impeding learning altogether.

One way to manage cognitive load as tasks become more complex is by using guided practice: creating 
a structure that narrowly guides focus on specific skills and knowledge in a stepped fashion, with 
feedback at each step before transferring attention to a new feature.

### Getting/giving feedback on teaching

Teaching is a skill. One of the objective of this instructor training is to give 
you the confidence in teaching ENCCS lessons. Later we will have group work where we 
will practice teaching some lessons.

Before doing so, we will learn here to give feedback on teaching using the same 
positive-vs-negative and content-vs-presentation rubric.

> ## Give feedback on teaching (optional, 10 min)
> 
> This exercise aims at learning to give feedback. It is optional as we have 
> similar exercises when {doc}`practising teaching <exercises>`).
> As a group, we will watch [this video of teaching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ApVt04rB4U) and
> give feedback on two axes: positive vs. negative and content vs. presentation. Have each person in
> the class add one point to a 2x2 grid on a whiteboard or in the shared notes  (hackMD, etherpad, google doc) without duplicating any points.
> For online instructor training event, use breakout room (4-5 persons per group) to facilitate discussion. Then each group reports to the shared notes.
> You can use a [rubric](http://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/demos_rubric/) (used during The Carpentries teaching demos) to help you take notes.
> What did other people see that you missed? What did they think that you strongly agree or disagree with?
