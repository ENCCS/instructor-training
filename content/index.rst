ENCCS instructor training
=========================

This ENCCS instructor training material is focused on helping competent practitioners
and experts teach their knowledge to others. It also serves a
kickstart to teaching ENCCS lessons.

Much of the material presented here is derived from two instructor training resources 
developed in the `CodeRefinery project <https://coderefinery.org/>`__, which in turn are 
derived from `The Carpentries <https://carpentries.org/>`__ instructor training lesson:

- `CodeRefinery Community Teaching <https://coderefinery.github.io/community-teaching/>`__
- `CodeRefinery Instructor Training <https://coderefinery.github.io/instructor-training/>`__
- `Carpentries Instructor Training <https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/>`__



.. prereq::

   This course has no strict prerequisites, but

   * It is helpful if you have attended an ENCCS or CodeRefinery
     workshop, which teach in an interactive and hands-on way.

   * We assume you already have competence in the technical tools you
     want to teach.

   * While not a prerequisite for this course, version control (Git)
     is necessary to contribute to lessons development the way we show
     here (but the lesson design concepts are applicable to other
     styles, too).

Who is the course for?
----------------------

Teaching is a profession, but also something that everyone needs to be
able to do to some degree, since everyone has their own personal
specialties they will either teach or mentor.

This course can be relevant for different learner personas:

- **You run a practical teaching program** at your institution (for example
  as part of a research computing group) and would like to learn best
  practices for collaborative teaching of technical topics, so that you aren't re-inventing
  the same thing over and over again.

- **You are a technical specialist** who is frustrated with the way you
  currently try to teach others who need to use your software or
  infrastructure.  You can't spend too much time to become a
  professional, but you know you need something more than what you've
  been doing.  Thus, you would like to adopt some of the best practices of
  designing and teaching interactive, hands-on workshops.

- **You've been teaching alone**, but would like to join a collaboration
  network for more co-teaching and to reduce the amount of duplication
  of effort.

- **You are interested in teaching ENCCS lessons**, and would like a
  comprehensive kick-start to how ENCCS workshops work, either to join us,
  or teach our lessons with us or independently.
