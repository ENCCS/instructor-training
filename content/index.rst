CodeRefinery instructor training
================================

CodeRefinery instructor training is focused on helping competent practitioners
and experts teach their knowledge to others.  It also serves a
kickstart to teaching CodeRefinery lessons, but we also have a
gradual pathway of learner → helper → advanced helper → instructor as
well.



.. prereq::

   This course has no strict prerequisites, but

   * It is helpful if you have attended CodeRefinery or Carpentries
     workshops, which teach in an interactive and hands-on way.

   * We assume you already have competence in the technical tools you
     want to teach.  Many of our concepts use examples from
     CodeRefinery lessons, such as version control or other software
     development tools.

   * While not a prerequisite for this course, version control (git)
     is necessary to contribute to lessons development the way we show
     here (but the lesson design concepts are applicable to other
     styles, too).
