## The Carpentries approach to teaching

Here we will give you a very short overview of the Carpentries approach to teaching and highlight parts that are most important for teaching ENCCS style lessons.

Most ENCCS instructors have completed the
[Carpentry instructor training workshop](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/), which
[anyone can apply for](https://carpentries.org/become-instructor/).

The "Carpentries" approach to teaching is based on:

- Applying research-based teaching principles, especially as they apply to the 
  Carpentries audience.
- Understanding the importance of a respectful and inclusive classroom environment.


### Key aspects

ENCCS teaches computational competences to learners through an applied approach. 
Usually, we avoid the theoretical and general in favor of the practical and specific. By 
showing learners how to solve specific problems with specific tools and providing hands-on 
practice, we develop learners’ confidence and empower them to start applying new knowledge 
immediately.

- Learners need to practice what they are learning in real time and get **feedback** on what they are doing. That is why the teaching approach relies on **live coding**.
- Learners best learn in a respectful and motivating classroom environment, so it's important to use a **Code of Conduct** and avoid certain demotivating language. 
- Learners are encouraged to help each other and collaborate during workshops as this improves their confidence and reinforces concepts taught.

## Who are your learners?

The first task in teaching is to figure out who your learners are. According to the 
[Dreyfus model of skill acquisition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_model_of_skill_acquisition) learners acquire skills and advance
through distinct stages through practice and formal instruction. In simplified form, the three stages of this model are:

### Novices, competent practitioners and experts

![Novice, Competent Practitioner, Expert](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/fig/skill-level.svg)

-   *Novice*: someone who doesn't know what they don't know, i.e.,
    they don't yet know what the key ideas in the domain are or how they relate.
    One sign that someone is a novice is that their questions "aren't even wrong".
-   *Competent practitioner*: someone who has enough understanding for everyday purposes. 
    They won't know all the details of how something works and their understanding may not
    be entirely accurate, but it is sufficient for completing normal tasks with normal 
    effort under normal circumstances.
-   *Expert*: someone who can easily handle situations that are out of the ordinary.

Participants in ENCCS workshops are usually *competent practitioners*. They already write 
code and know what additional tools or techniques they need to learn to accomplish their goals.

## Cognitive development and mental models

Effective learning is facilitated by the creation of a well-founded *mental model*. 
A mental model is a collection of concepts and facts, along with the relationships 
between those concepts, which a person has about a topic. 

For example, a long-time European resident may have an 
advanced understanding of the location of European countries, major cities and landmarks, weather patterns, regional economies and demographic patterns, as well as the relationships 
among these, compared with their understanding of these relationships for other countries. 
In other words, their mental model of Europe is more complex compared with their mental model 
of other countries.

We can distinguish between a *novice* and a *competent practitioner* for a given domain based 
on the complexity of their mental models.

- A *novice* has a minimal mental model of surface features of the domain. Inaccuracies based on limited prior knowledge may interfere with adding new information. Predictions are likely to borrow heavily from mental models of other domains which seem superficially similar.
- A *competent* practitioner has a mental model that is useful for everyday purposes. Most new information they are likely to encounter will fit well with their existing model. Even though many potential elements of their mental model may still be missing or wrong, predictions about their area of work are usually accurate.
- An *expert* has a densely populated and connected mental model that is especially good for problem solving. They quickly connect concepts that others may not see as being related. They may have difficulty explaining how they are thinking in ways that do not rely on other features unique to their own mental model.

![Mental Models](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/fig/mental_models.svg)

### Understanding new ideas

Learners absorb new knowledge most effectively when it connects with what they already 
know. We can understand this as adding new nodes and their connections to existing nodes 
to their mental models.

*Good analogies* can be extraordinarily useful when teaching, because they draw upon an 
existing mental model to fill in another, speeding learning and making a memorable 
connection. However, all analogies have limitations! If you choose to use an analogy, be sure 
its usefulness outweighs its potential to generate misconceptions that may interfere with 
learning.


### How “knowledge” gets in the way

Mental models are hardly ever built from scratch. Every learner comes to a topic with
some amount of information, ideas and opinions about the topic. This is true even in
the case where a learner can’t articulate their prior knowledge and beliefs.

In many cases, this prior knowledge is incomplete or inaccurate. Inaccurate beliefs
("misconceptions") can impede learning by making it more difficult for
learners to incorporate new, correct information into their mental models. 
Correcting learners’ misconceptions is at least as important as presenting them with 
correct information. Broadly speaking, misconceptions fall into three categories:

- **Simple factual errors**. These are the easiest to correct.
- **Broken models**. We can address these by having learners reason through examples to
    see contradictions.
- **Fundamental beliefs**. These beliefs are deeply connected
    to the learner’s social identity and are the hardest to change.

## Memory

Here we will be learning more about human memory: specifically, how to remove unnecessary 
"load" in order to facilitate learning.

### Types of memory

Learning involves memory. For our purposes, human memory can be divided into two different 
layers. The first is called **long-term**. It is where we store persistent information like 
our friends' names and our home address. It is essentially unbounded but it is slow to access.

Our second layer of memory is called **short-term**. This is the type of memory you use to 
actively think about things and is often called *working memory*. It is much faster, but also 
much smaller: in 1956, George Miller estimated that the average adult's short-term memory 
could hold 7±2 items for a few seconds before things started to drop out. 

This has important implications for teaching. If we present our learners with large amounts 
of information, without giving them the opportunity to practice using it (and thereby 
transfer it into long-term memory), they will not retain the material as well as if we 
present small amounts of information interspersed with practice opportunities. This is yet 
another reason why going slowly and using frequent formative assessment is important.

### Memory management

- **Chunking**: Our minds can store larger numbers of facts in short-term memory by creating 
  chunks, or relationships among separate items, allowing them to be remembered as a single 
  item. Connecting information makes it easier to remember.
- **Formative assessment to support memory consolidation**: Formative assessment helps 
  learners solidify their understanding and begin transferring ideas into long-term memory.
  Limitations of short-term memory are one reason why assessments should be frequent: short-term memory is limited not only in space, but also in time.
- **Group work**: Elaboration (explaining your work) supports transfer to long-term 
  memory. This is one reason why teaching is one of the most effective ways to learn! Group 
  work can feel uncomfortable at first and consumes time in a workshop, but learners often 
  rate group work as a high point for both enjoyment and learning in a workshop.   
- **Opportunities for reflection**: Reflection is another tool that can help learners review 
  things they have learned, strengthen connections between them, and consolidate long-term 
  memories. Asking learners for feedback can be an effective consolidating prompt as providing 
  feedback demands some reflection on what has been learned.
- **Limit concepts**:  It is important to limit the number of concepts introduced in a lesson, but   
  this can be hard! Planning your lesson with a concept map can help you not only identify key 
  concepts and relationships, but also to notice when you are trying to teach too many things at 
  once.


- meaning
- connect with previous knowledge
- stick to the script (conflicting info inhibits learning)

## On the importance of feedback

Feedback is an essential part of effective learning. Feedback is bi-directional:
- To be effective, instructors need feedback on their learners' progress. Learners can also check their progress and ask relevant questions to get clarification.
- Instructors also need feedback on their teaching. For instance, this can help them to adapt the pace, add/skip optional exercises and improve their teaching.

### Getting/giving feedback on learners' progress

This feedback comes through what is called *formative assessments* (in contrast
  to *summative assessment*).

> ## Summative Assessment
> *Summative assessment* is used
> to judge whether a learner has reached an acceptable level of competence.
> Usually at the end of a course 
> Learners either "pass" or "fail" a summative assessment.

{: .callout}

Learners don't "pass" or "fail" formative assessments; they are simply a feedback mechanism.
For example, a music teacher might ask a learner to play a scale very slowly
in order to see whether they are breathing correctly,
and if not, what they should change.

Formative assessment is most useful when it happens frequently (we'll talk about how frequently later)
and when the results are easily interpretable by the learner and instructor.

ENCCS uses different instruments to get feedback from learners:

- Surveys: we will discuss ENCCS surveys in the episode {doc}`workshops-online`.
- Exercises and quizzes: we have many exercises during ENCCS workshops and also use polls to keep participants engaged and to obtain quick feedback on their progress.




### Getting/giving feedback on teaching

Teaching is a skill. One of the objective of this instructor training is to give 
you the confidence in teaching ENCCS lessons. Later we will have group work where we 
will practice teaching some lessons.

Before doing so, we will learn here to give feedback on teaching using the same 
positive-vs-negative and content-vs-presentation rubric.

> ## Give feedback on teaching (optional, 10 min)
> 
> This exercise aims at learning to give feedback. It is optional as we have 
> similar exercises when {doc}`practising teaching <exercises>`).
> As a group, we will watch [this video of teaching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ApVt04rB4U) and
> give feedback on two axes: positive vs. negative and content vs. presentation. Have each person in
> the class add one point to a 2x2 grid on a whiteboard or in the shared notes  (hackMD, etherpad, google doc) without duplicating any points.
> For online instructor training event, use breakout room (4-5 persons per group) to facilitate discussion. Then each group reports to the shared notes.
> You can use a [rubric](http://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/demos_rubric/) (used during The Carpentries teaching demos) to help you take notes.
> What did other people see that you missed? What did they think that you strongly agree or disagree with?

## Examples and exercises

Well designed examples and exercises can go a long way towards correcting misconceptions 
and expanding the mental models of learners.
