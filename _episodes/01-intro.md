# The CodeRefinery project

CodeRefinery is a [Nordic e-Infrastructure Collaboration (NeIC)](https://neic.no/) project that has started in October 2016 and will end in October 2021.

The project has four main goals:

- Develop and maintain training material on software best practices for researchers that already write code. Our material addresses all academic disciplines and tries to be as programming language-independent as possible.
- Provide a [code repository hosting service](https://coderefinery.org/repository/) that is open and free for all researchers based in universities and research institutes from Nordic countries
- Provide training opportunities in the Nordics using Carpentries and CodeRefinery training materials
- Articulate and implement the CodeRefinery sustainability plan

## Does CodeRefinery make a difference?

3-6 months after attending a workshop, past participants are asked to complete a short post-workshop survey.
The survey questions aim to establish what impact CodeRefinery workshops have on how past participants develop 
research software.

![post-workshop survey results](https://coderefinery.org/assets/img/heatmap_yesno.png)

- Overall quality of research software has improved: more reusable, modular, reproducible and documentated.
- Collaboration on research software development has become easier
- Past participants share their new knowledge with colleagues
- Usage of several tools is improved, and new tools are adopted

## Carpentries membership

Since November 2018, [NeIC](https://neic.no) is a [Platinum Partner](https://carpentries.org/members/) to [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/).

The Carpentries teaches foundational coding and data science skills to researchers worldwide and as such is complementary to CodeRefinery. 
an international successful project that comprises Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry, communities of Instructors, Trainers, Maintainers, helpers, 
and supporters who share a mission to teach foundational computational and data science skills to researchers. With this we have access to:

- 6 Carpentries workshops in the Nordics each year. The workshop fee is on us, only the instructor travel is on the host institution.
- 15 seats in the Carpentries instructor training each year. Carpentries train the trainer program aims at building partnerships with Research Software Engineers and researchers who are willing to lead skills' transfer within their local communities in the Nordics.

## Goal of this workshop

One important challenge of CodeRefinery is to become sustainable by the end of the project. To be able to maintain and develop further CodeRefinery lessons, it is important to have a sufficient number of qualified instructors and maintainers. 

This instructor training workshop aims to increase the number of CodeRefinery instructors 
and thus contribute to the project's sustainability.

## Carpentries and CodeRefinery target audience

### Carpentries audience

The carpentries is primarily concerned with **novices**. 

It aims to teach computational **competence** to learners through an applied approach, avoiding the theoretical and general in favor of the practical and specific. 
By showing learners how to solve specific problems with specific tools and providing hands-on practice, learners develops confidence for future learning.

### CodeRefinery audience

In that sense, CodeRefinery differs significantly as we assume our audience already write codes and we aims at teaching them **best software practices**.

Our target audience is a *competent practitioner** writing codes on a regular basis but that usually does not have a good overview of **best software practices**.

Whenever we can, we direct **novices** to Carpentries workshops.


## CodeRefinery training philosophies

Here CodeRefinery instructors share their training philosophy. The main goal is to show that we all have different teaching styles and how these differences are beneficial to CodeRefinery workshops.

It is important to explain how much we value individuals and that there is not one way to teach but as many ways as individuals. The goal is to help each others to find the way that is best for each of us.

### Anne Fouilloux

I regularly teach Carpentries workshops so I try to apply what I have learnt to CodeRefinery workshops. However, I know our target audience is very much different and that I need to adapt my teaching style. I am still trying to find what works best in which situations and this is why I like so much CodeRefinery workshops. We usually have a wider range of skills and very mixed backgrounds so we usually have to be more careful with the pace and time given for exercises.

Some considerations:
- I spend quite a lot of time reading the CodeRefinery material and practising myself exercises. I particularly like to read the instructor notes just before teaching: they usually highlight important aspects both for preparing and teaching. 
- I usually do not show too much in advance the material as I think it prevents asking questions. If you have less competent practitioners in the classroom, they can easily copy-paste to avoid slowing down the entire classroom.
- Ideally, I'd like to give several exercises so anyone can work at its own pace. I find it is important that everybody gets something different from the workshop. 
- I love breaks as it gives us an opportunity to discuss with attendees on their research topics. I am especially interested to understand what software they write and how they plan to use what they learn during our workshops.

# CodeRefinery lessons and workshop

## What is a CodeRefinery workshop?

In this section, we explain briefly what is a CodeRefinery workshop and in particular how much we can mix and match lessons for new workshops.

Practical information on how to organize a workshop will be given later.

You are free to use this material, but please [let us know](https://coderefinery.org/contact/) - it is important for us to know whether this material has impact outside of our workshops.

We usually run our workshops in 3 days and to get an overview of a typical CodeRefinery workshop, look at the programme  [here](https://coderefinery.org/workshops/2019-10-22-trondheim/).

However, anyone is free to mix and match to define its own CodeRefinery programme.

### Lightning overview of all lessons 

Details on lessons will be given later, so here we mostly give a very short overview of each CodeRefinery lesson.

> ## Exercise: Learning objectives
> Split in group of 3-4 persons and choose one of the presented CodeRefinery lesson.
> 1. Give feedback on two axes: positive vs. negative and content vs. presentation.
> 1. Discuss the learning objectives and how they fit to CodeRefinery objectives that are to improve researcher's best software practices.
