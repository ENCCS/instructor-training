## Welcome

## CodeRefinery goals

CodeRefinery is a [Nordic e-Infrastructure Collaboration (NeIC)](https://neic.no/) project that has started in October 2016 and will end in October 2021.

The project has four main goals:

- Develop and maintain training material on software best practices for researchers that already write code. Our material addresses all academic disciplines and tries to be as programming language-independent as possible.
- Provide a [code repository hosting service](https://coderefinery.org/repository/) that is open and free for all researchers based in universities and research institutes from Nordic countries
- Provide training opportunities in the Nordics using Carpentries and CodeRefinery training materials
- Articulate and implement the CodeRefinery sustainability plan

This instructor training lesson aims at increasing the number of CodeRefinery instructors hence contributes to the project sustainability.

### Carpentries membership

One important challenge of CodeRefinery is to become sustainable by the end of the project. To be able to maintain and develop further CodeRefinery lessons, it is important to have enough instructors and maintainers. 

Since November 2018, [NeIC](https://neic.no) is a [Platinum Partner](https://carpentries.org/members/) to [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/).

The Carpentries teaches foundational coding and data science skills to researchers worldwide and as such is complementary to CodeRefinery. 
an international successful project that comprises Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry, communities of Instructors, Trainers, Maintainers, helpers, 
and supporters who share a mission to teach foundational computational and data science skills to researchers. With this we have access to:

- 6 Carpentries workshops in the Nordics each year. The workshop fee is on us, only the instructor travel is on the host institution.
- 15 seats in the Carpentries instructor training each year. Carpentries train the trainer program aims at building partnerships with Research Software Engineers and researchers who are willing to lead skills' transfer within their local communities in the Nordics.

## Carpentries approach to teaching

We will give you a short overview of the Carpentries approach to teaching and highlight parts that are most important for teaching CodeRefinery lessons.

In the "Carpentries" approach to teaching, emphasis is put on:

- Applying research-based teaching principles, especially as they apply to the Carpentries audience.
- understanding the importance of a respectful and inclusive classroom environment.

Before going into details, let's firt explain what are these teaching principles:


### Mental Models and Formative Assessment

The first task in teaching is to figure out who your learners are.

### Novices, Competent practitioners and experts

![Novice, Competent Practitioner, Expert](../fig/skill-level.svg)

*   *Novice*: someone who doesn't know what they don't know, i.e.,
    they don't yet know what the key ideas in the domain are or how they relate.
    One sign that someone is a novice is that their questions "aren't even wrong".

     > Example: A *novice* learner in a Carpentries workshop might never have heard of the bash shell, and therefore
     may have no understanding of how it relates to their file system or other programs on their computer.

*   *Competent practitioner*: someone who has enough understanding for everyday purposes. They won't know all the details
    of how something works and their understanding may not be entirely accurate, but it is sufficient for completing normal
    tasks with normal effort under normal circumstances.

    > Example: A *competent practitioner* in a Carpentries workshop might have used the shell before and understand how to
    move around directories and use individual programs, but they might not understand how they can fit these programs
    together to build scripts and automate large tasks.

*   *Expert*: someone who can easily handle situations that are out of the ordinary.

    > Example: An *expert* in a Carpentries workshop may have experience writing and running shell scripts and, when
    presented with a problem, immediately sees how these skills can be used to solve the problem.

### Carpentries audience

The carpentries is primarily concerned with **novices**. In that sense, CodeRefinery differs significantly as we assume our audience already write codes and we aims at teaching them **best software practices**.

It aims to teach computational **competence** to learners through an applied approach, avoiding the theoretical and general in favor of the practical and specific. 
By showing learners how to solve specific problems with specific tools and providing hands-on practice, learners develops confidence for future learning.


## CodeRefinery training philosophies

Here CodeRefinery instructors share their training philosophy. The main goal is to show that we all have different teaching styles and how these differences are beneficial to CodeRefinery workshops.

It is important to explain how much we value individuals and that there is not one way to teach but as many ways as individuals. The goal is to help each others to find the way that is best for each of us.

## CodeRefinery lessons and workshop


### What is a CodeRefinery workshop?

In this section, we explain briefly what is a CodeRefinery workshop and in particular how much we can mix and match lessons for new workshops.

Practical information on how to organize a workshop will be given later.

### Lightning overview of all lessons 

Details on lessons will be given later, so here we mostly give a very short overview of each CodeRefinery lesson.
