# CodeRefinery Sustainability plan

In October 2018 CodeRefinery entered the second phase of the project, with funding from [NeIC](https://neic.no)
until autumn 2021. A key objective for CodeRefinery 2.0 is to **render the project largely self-sustained after 
October 2021**.

## Vision

- After phase 2, travel and accommodation for workshops will be financed by the hosting
  institution, similarly to the Carpentries model. 
- The lesson material will be maintained by the community and volunteers but employers will be
  encouraged to allow instructors across Nordics to participate in-kind in 1-2 workshops/year. 
- A completely self-financed organization may not be realistic, but we aim to arrive at
  a project which can continue using 0.5 - 1 FTE/year for coordination.

Reaching this goal will depend on developing institutional recognition for the project.  
But how do we get there?

## Benefits 

- More competent scientists and researchers
  - Software development is a core part of research for many scientists and researchers in the Nordics 
  - CodeRefinery contributes to an increased competence in software development tools and techniques among scientists and researchers.
  - Preparation and delivery of workshops is also a great learning opportunity for the instructors
- Better science
  - Reproducibility of research code
  - Reusable and extensible code
  - Collaborative learning and knowledge transfer
