# CodeRefinery lessons and workshop

In this section, we explain briefly what's covered in a typical CodeRefinery workshop 
and how much we can mix and match lessons for new workshops.

Practical information on how to organize a workshop will be given later.

### Lightning overview of all lessons 

Details on lessons will be given later, so here we mostly give a very short overview of each CodeRefinery lesson.

- [Git intro](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/) (Sabry)
- [Collaborative Git](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-collaborative/) (Juho)
- [Modular code development](http://cicero.xyz/v3/remark/0.14.0/github.com/coderefinery/modular-code-development/master/talk.md) (Radovan)
- [Documentation](https://coderefinery.github.io/documentation/) (Anne)
- [Jupyter](https://coderefinery.github.io/jupyter/) (Thor)
- [Social coding](http://cicero.xyz/v3/remark/0.14.0/github.com/coderefinery/social-coding/master/talk.md) (Richard)
- [Automated testing](https://coderefinery.github.io/testing/) (Bj√∏rn)
- [Reproducible research](https://coderefinery.github.io/reproducible-research/) (Thor)

Each overview can consist of some combination of (choose the most
important to fit the time):
* Learning objectives
* What's covered, teaching strategy
* Particularly interesting (groups of) exercises
* How it relates to other lessons
* Future development needed
* (History of the lesson, if interesting)
