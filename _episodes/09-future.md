## Near future of CodeRefinery


## Brainstorming about new lessons


## Roadmap for future CodeRefinery lessons


## Hands-on Scientific Computing


## Broader scientific computing plan in Nordics

CodeRefinery is just one aspect of support.  We have thought of three
key aspects of scientific computing that need to connect:

* Easier to use infrastructure (e.g. computational clusters - being
  developed in the new [NordicHPC](https://nordichpc.github.io)
  project)
* Training and teaching (CodeRefinery)
* Hands-on support (Research Software Engineer network)

All of these are under development, and are somehow related to the
CodeRefinery team.

Each of these three things should coordinate with the other.  One
favorite example is: if something about using the HPC clusters is
difficult to teach, perhaps you should just fix the infrastructure so
that you don't have to teach the quirk.  Problems you see during
hands-on support should be relayed back to the teaching and to the
infrastructure teams.

How should these be coordinated?  Our current idea is to:

* Develop NordicHPC is an cluster collaboration, not of hardware, but
  of sysadmin tips and tricks with a focus on usability and
  standardization.
* Make CodeRefinery self-sustaining
* Develop a Research Software Engineer network in the Nordics, with
  meetings and training.

Perhaps each of these can have one big yearly meeting, with each of
the other two groups having a presentations and co-located events at
the other two.

CodeRefinery is funded by the [Nordic e-Infrastructure
Collaboration](https://neic.no), and NordicHPC probably will be as
well.  Thus, NeIC is a logical coordinating and funding body.

Nordics (everything in NeIC) are logical size for collaboration:
local, existing connections, but we don't want to be exclusive.
