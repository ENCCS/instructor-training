# Sustainability plan

In October 2018 CodeRefinery entered the second phase of the project, with funding from [NeIC](https://neic.no)
until autumn 2021. A key objective for CodeRefinery 2.0 is to **render the project largely self-sustained after
October 2021**.

## Vision

- After phase 2, travel and accommodation for workshops will be financed by the hosting
  institution, similarly to the Carpentries model.
- The lesson material will be maintained by the community, volunteers, and in-kind staff time.
- Employers will be encouraged to allow instructors across Nordics to participate in-kind in 1-2 workshops/year.
- A completely self-financed organization may not be realistic, but we aim to arrive at
  a project which can continue using 0.5-1 FTE/year for coordination.

Reaching this goal will depend on **developing institutional recognition** for the project.
But how do we get there?

---

## Benefits

Universities, e-Science initiatives and other organizations need to be convinced to
support or otherwise endorse CodeRefinery.

The pitch can be quite simple - continuity of the CodeRefinery project will lead to:
- More competent scientists and researchers
  - Software development is a core part of research for many scientists and researchers
  - CodeRefinery contributes to an increased competence in software development tools and techniques among scientists and researchers
  - Preparation and delivery of workshops is also a great learning opportunity for the instructors
- Better science
  - Reproducibility of research code
  - Reusable and extensible code
  - Collaborative learning and knowledge transfer

---

## Challenges

In theory, everyone is happy with training.  In practice, once it is
no longer free, how will it continue?

- Minimum effort needed for a workshop:
  - Coordination in months before workshop
  - Three instructor travel and accommodation for three days
  - Time to prepare, time to teach.
- Will institutions be able to budget for staff costs?

---

## Example: Recurring workshops

Aalto University and soon KTH and Trondheim provide examples of recurring workshops:

- A well-defined and connected target audience
- Local workshops twice a year
- One or two local (non-CodeRefinery staff) instructors locally
- Zero or one remote CodeRefinery instructors travel (and one or two
  CodeRefinery instructors already in the city).
- Workshops have been made "routine" - minimal advance discussion
  needed.

---

## Option 1

- Routine workshops
  - A host institution provides 1-2 local instructors
  - Host institution pays for 1-2 remote instructors to travel, but no salary
  - Host institution sends 1-2 instructors to some other remote
    workshop at a different partner.
- Bootstraping new members
  - Other sites kickstart a new institution by sending more
    instructors and demonstrating a full workshop.  Initial instructor
    training begins.
- Coordination
  - Central coordination, new institutions can easily join.
  - .5-1 FTE funded by NeIC or by partner fees?
- Training and meetings
  - Yearly meeting and training funded somehow...

---

## Option 2: peer to peer

A smaller way to start would be to take a core group of institutions
(e.g. Aalto and KTH) and they agree to send an instructor back and
forth twice a year for networking and teaching a workshop.  Possibly
as part of [NordicHPC](https://nordichpc.github.io) and other collaboration?  This would require less
central coordination, and eventually merge into option 1.

---

## Building a community

Building a community will be another essential requirement to reach sustainability.

Several avenues should be pursued:

- Train-the-trainer program
  - Promote, train, and certify future trainers at annual train-the-trainer workshops
- Symbiosis with The Carpentries and PRACE advanced training centers
  - CodeRefinery can be positioned as the second step after attending a Carpentry workshop
  - Coordinating with PRACE advanced training centers, embed CodeRefinery workshops within PRACE?
- Symbiosis with local units
  - Partner with universities to bring workshops to their community as a default service
  - Aalto Science IT to serve as perfect model
- [Research software engineer (RSE) community in the Nordics](http://nordic-rse.org/)
  - CodeRefinery can serve as a hub
  - Bi-annual or annual conferences, inspired by [UK-RSE](https://rse.ac.uk/conf2019/)

---

## What can you do?

- First and foremost: teach workshops!
- Spread the word. Tell friends and colleagues about upcoming workshops
  and encourage them to become instructors.
- Contribute new material or ideas for new material and/or suggestions for existing material.
- Talk to your higher-ups. Is your employer willing to contribute in-kind?

## Near future of CodeRefinery

- How to get new workshop requests?
- How to get attendee interest?
- How to reach research groups who don't know about this project?
- How to get instructor interest?
- What's our capacity for workshops?


## Brainstorming about new lessons

- What lessons are useful and don't exist?
- Which of these are in the scope of CodeRefinery?
- What is an appropriate length and level of modularity for lessons,
  so that they can be most easily reused and remixed?


## Nordic Research Software Engineer network

- CodeRefinery is trying to start a network of Research Software
  Engineers in the Nordics.
- Nordic RSE conference in 2020. Date and location is not yet set.


## Hands-on Scientific Computing

We have *plenty* of lessons.  So does Software Carpentry, and all the
rest of the Internet.  Yet this still isn't enough.

* There is information overload.  How does one know what to study?
* How do you know which lessons are suitable to your level?
* How do we convey the importance (and relative competence levels) to
  those involved in student and researcher training.

[Hands-on Scientific
Computing](https://handsonscicomp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a
course idea, started at Aalto University but essentially a join
CodeRefinery project, to organize existing material into different
levels of competence, so that we can convey.

Hands-on SciComp isn't actually supposed to be a course.  It's
supposed to *organize* existing courses into a logical program for
self-study and possible academic use.

{: .challenge}

Hand-on SciComp is organized by:

* Levels (A to F), indicating the overall level of
  competence.  For example, C is "Linux and shell" while D is
  "Clusters and HPC".
* Modules, a small, self-contained topic which one can get begin to
  understand in 10 minutes and learn the basics of in 60 minutes.
* Different types of material for different learning styles:
  * A 10-15 minute video introduction, that explains why it's
    important, shows some live examples, and give a taste of what is
    to come
  * Link(s) to reading material, some of which can be understood in
    about an hour.
  * A "site-specific" column, which allows the material to be
    customized for different locations.

Learner personas:

* Our [initial user
  interviews](https://github.com/coderefinery/handsonscicomp/issues/8)
  can be found on Github.  These show a strong need of a program such
  as HoSC.
* A is a researcher who has just started.  They have a good academic
  background, but not so much experience in Linux or non-academic
  programming.  They discuss with their supervisor, who says that they
  should have a good understanding of the A, B, and C levels, with
  some experience in D.  They should study this before beginning their
  research work.
* B is a new student in a data-sciencey field.  They are learning lots
  of academic skills, but don't have the network to learn Linux or
  practical programming skills (this isn't considered an academic
  field in this program).  Without tools such as git or shell, they
  can't work quickly.  HoSC serves as a parallel, practical guide to
  students.

Short-term plan:

* Study the levels and modules, and determine what the good set is.
* Understand needs of other partners: how can we cover all needs
  without being too specific?

Medium-term plan:

* Ideally, we won't be making any of our own material: we'll just link
  to the existing best material which is already available.
* We'll have to add our own framing and connecting, to express the
  high-level connections of the modules and practical work.
* Where needed, we'll fill in our material or encourage other groups
  to make the material we are missing.

Long-term plan:

* Collaborative, open-project project
* Connection to researcher training.
* Connection to academic degree programs.
* Promote modularization of lessons, so that they can be more easily
  re-used in programs like this.


## Broader scientific computing plan in Nordics

CodeRefinery is just one aspect of support.  We have thought of three
key aspects of scientific computing that need to connect:

* Easier to use infrastructure (e.g. computational clusters - being
  developed in the new [NordicHPC](https://nordichpc.github.io)
  project)
* Training and teaching (CodeRefinery)
* Hands-on support (Research Software Engineer network)

All of these are under development, and are somehow related to the
CodeRefinery team.

Each of these three things should coordinate with the other.  One
favorite example is: if something about using the HPC clusters is
difficult to teach, perhaps you should just fix the infrastructure so
that you don't have to teach the quirk.  Problems you see during
hands-on support should be relayed back to the teaching and to the
infrastructure teams.

How should these be coordinated?  Our current idea is to:

* Develop NordicHPC is an cluster collaboration, not of hardware, but
  of sysadmin tips and tricks with a focus on usability and
  standardization.
* Make CodeRefinery self-sustaining
* Develop a Research Software Engineer network in the Nordics, with
  meetings and training.

Perhaps each of these can have one big yearly meeting, with each of
the other two groups having a presentations and co-located events at
the other two.

CodeRefinery is funded by the [Nordic e-Infrastructure
Collaboration](https://neic.no), and NordicHPC probably will be as
well.  Thus, NeIC is a logical coordinating and funding body.

Nordics (everything in NeIC) are logical size for collaboration:
local, existing connections, but we don't want to be exclusive.
